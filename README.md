Evaluate Markdown code blocks within Vim.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/306995.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/306995)

## Description

Medieval allows you to evaluate code blocks in Markdown buffers of the
following form:

````markdown
```bash
echo "Hello world!"
```
````

By placing your cursor anywhere in the code block above and running
`:EvalBlock`, Medieval will print the result of evaluating the block (in this
case, it will echo "Hello world!")

You can also redirect the output of the evaluation into a register using
`:EvalBlock @{0-9a-z".=*+}`.

You can send the output of evaluation into another code block, allowing
you to do a primitive style of literate programming. You can accomplish this
by adding a "target" parameter to your code block and creating a second code
block with a "name" parameter. The output of the evaluation of your code block
will be redirected to the targeted block. For example:

````markdown
<!-- target: squares -->
```python
print([x*x for x in range(5)])
```

<!-- name: squares -->
```
```
````

If you run `:EvalBlock` in the first code block, the second block will become

````markdown
<!-- name: squares -->
```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```
````

You can manually specify a target block using `:EvalBlock {target}`. With
`[!]`, `:EvalBlock` will cause the evaluated code block to replace its own
contents with the result of its evaluation:

````markdown
```sh
fortune
```
````

After `:EvalBlock!`:

````markdown
```sh
The difference between art and science is that science is what we
understand well enough to explain to a computer.  Art is everything else.
                -- Donald Knuth, "Discover"
```
````

The target block can be either another code block (delimited by `` ``` `` or
`~~~`) or a LaTeX math block (delimited by `$$`):

````markdown
<!-- target: math -->
```python
print(r"\text{Hello LaTeX!}")
```

<!-- name: math -->
$$
\text{Hello LaTeX!}
$$
````

The block labels must be of the form `<!-- target: <NAME>` or `<!-- name:
<NAME>`. The label can be preceeded by whitespace, but no other characters. The
label itself can be composed of the following characters: `0-9A-Za-z_+.$#&-`.
Note that the closing tag of the HTML comment is not required. This allows you
to embed the code block within an HTML block comment so that the block will not
be rendered in the final output. For example:

````markdown
<!-- target: example
```sh
echo '$ ls -1'
ls -1
```
-->

<!-- name: example -->
```sh
$ ls -1
LICENSE
README.md
after
autoload
doc
```
````

In this example, only the output block will be rendered, since the "source"
block is nested within an HTML comment.

## Configuration

Medieval will only attempt to execute code blocks in languages explicitly
listed in the variable `g:medieval_langs`. The structure of this variable is a
list of strings corresponding to whitelisted languages that can be
interpreted. If a language's interpreter has a different name than the
language itself, you can use the form `{lang}={interpreter}` to specify what
interpreter should be used.

For example, to allow Medieval to run Python, Ruby, and shell scripts, use

```vim
let g:medieval_langs = ['python=python3', 'ruby', 'sh', 'console=bash']
```

By default, `g:medieval_langs` is empty, so you **must** specify this variable
yourself.

## Create a mapping

Medieval does not create any mappings by default, but you can easily create one
yourself by adding the following to the file
`~/.vim/after/ftplugin/markdown.vim` (create it if it does not yet exist):

```vim
nnoremap <buffer> Z! :<C-U>EvalBlock<CR>
```

## Limitations

For now, Medieval only works in Markdown buffers. If you'd like to see support
added for other file types, please see the [Contributing](#contributing)
section.
